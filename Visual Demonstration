## Visual Demonstration

This section shows the Secure File Encryptor in action, walking through the process of selecting, encrypting, and decrypting a file.

1. **First Example**: Select a file (e.g., `test.txt`) and enter a password to prepare for encryption. The file’s original content is shown on the right.

2. **Output**: After clicking "Encrypt File," the file is encrypted in place, and the original hash is saved. The file’s content is now unreadable encrypted data.

3. **Output 2**: After selecting the encrypted file and entering the password, click "Decrypt File." The file is decrypted, and a success message confirms the hash matches, verifying integrity. The original content is restored.
